## Overview
This project analyzes the factors influencing YouTube videos trending globally.  
It uses a dataset of trending videos from 10 countries, including metrics like views, likes, dislikes, and comments.

## Data & Methods
- Dataset: Trending videos with metadata such as category, title, description, tags, and publish time.  
- Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualization, and statistical tests (Chi-Square, Kruskal-Wallis).  
- Features studied: Video category, title/description sentiment, clickbait usage, upload timing, and engagement metrics.

## Key Findings
- **High engagement categories:** Music, entertainment, and film.  
- **Content features:** Title and description length have minimal impact.  
- **Sentiment & clickbait:** Positive sentiment and attention-grabbing words increase engagement.  
- **Comments:** Videos with comments enabled show higher engagement.  
- **Upload timing:** Peak engagement occurs on Fridays and afternoons.

## Insights
- Engagement differs significantly across categories but not weekdays.  
- Neutral titles dominate total engagement, while controversial videos spark discussion but attract fewer views.  
- Tags initially increase engagement, but excessive tags do not add value.

## Applications
These insights help new YouTubers optimize content strategy for higher views and engagement.  
Future work could include exploring tag effectiveness, audience demographics, and cross-country trends.
